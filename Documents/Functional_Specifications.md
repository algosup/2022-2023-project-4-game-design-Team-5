## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create an innovative game ( the genre and the theme are free ) using [Unreal Engine 4.27](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-4-27-released). We may choose a platform for the game to run on (PC, mobile, console, etc.) and we have multiple milestones to reach:

| Milestone | Description | Date |
| --------- | ----------- | ---- |
| Milestone 1 | Create a One-Sheet Document | 2023-03-03 |
| Milestone 2 | Create a prototype of the game | 2023-03-10 |
| Milestone 3 | Crete a playable version of the game for a demo | 2023-03-24 |
| Milestone 4 | Create a final version of the game to present | 2023-04-14 |

## Use case
